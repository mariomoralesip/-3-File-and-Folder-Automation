What's File and Folder Automation?

File and Folder Automation involves automating tasks you do with your files and folders on your computer, like creating, copying, or renaming them.

How do I use the activities?

You can find such actions as the ones listed above in the File/Folder section of the Activities panel. For this type of actions, you don't need a specific resource. You'll have to select those depending on the nature of the task you're automating, if it involves other kinds of activities, such as Excel, email, etc.

File and Folder Automation in action

It might be easier to understand the topic in relation to a realistic business scenario, so let's take a practical example. Meet Jude, the Financial Clerk. They deal with loads of invoices daily and, sadly, a considerable part of them have the name wrong.

For efficient record keeping, Jude must ensure all documents are named correctly, but this tedious and repetitive work takes up much time and energy, as it requires attention. 

What other business scenarios can I automate?

1- Versioning documents and folders - this is a common practice in companies, but it can be useful for any professional. You'll see how you can automate a simple versioning task in the Practice lesson.

2- Organizing a museum's archive - as a record-keeper, you have to keep track of each item in your archive - publications, transcripts, audio files, photos, videos, etc. - at the moment, the archive is chaotic. You can automate the organizing process with File and Folder Automation activities, creating folders for each category, sorting files according to the category, and standardizing the naming system.

3- Digitizing documents of a public institution - after the planning, preparation and scanning phases of the digitization project, you need to have a way to organize the documents. Instead of letting it take ages, you can automate the process and obtain clean results right away.
